# MercadoLibre Data Challenge 2020

Build a Machine Learning model to predict next purchase based on the user’s navigation history. 



Mercado Libre hosts millions of product and service listings. Users navigate through them on countless occasions, looking for what they want to buy or just to get ideas on a new purchase.

Understanding better what they might be interested in it’s critical to our business, so we can help them find what they’re looking for by providing customized recommendations based on the listings that are most suitable for each user's needs and preferences.

Given a week of a user’s navigation records, we challenge you to predict (aka recommend) the ten most likely items of the next purchase.
